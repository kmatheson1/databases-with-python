## Book STore Project Starter

# Challenge

Set up a new project called book_store from the starter.

Use the book_store SQL seed instead of the music_library seed. You can find this in the seeds directory in the starter.

Follow the design recipe as usual, before starting to test-drive the classes.

Once you've done the design recipe, start recording yourself.

Test-drive a Book class that has attributes for each column in the books table, using the example(s) from your design.

Test-drive a BookRepository class that has a method all that returns a list of Book objects.

Write a small program in app.py using the class BookRepository to print out the list of books to the terminal.
